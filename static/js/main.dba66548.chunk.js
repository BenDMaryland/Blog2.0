welcome to my very first blog post! As I've been learning more and more software developing I decided to put that to work by creating a blog, to serve both as practice and as a front end to show off some of my projects!\n\nThe Blog is currently in three parts.\n1. A page where I can post new blog posts.\n2. A JSON file \n3. A page where users can see my blog posts and add comments. \n\nCurrently on the area where I can make Blog posts I'm able to make blog posts with a Title and one image.  Plans: here are to be able to change font size add more images and change where they are posted to \n\nCurrently on the area where users can see my blog post. The blog posts are displayed with the newest one first.  I have a sidebar with links to my Linkedin and github. Users can search the blog and make comments. \nPlans: Allow users to make more comments, clean up the page a bit, publish this! \n\nAs for the JSON file, in the next couple weeks I'll be learning about backend development and will hold off any work on that until I've learned ruby!\n\nAs for developing the blog, it's gone through three iterations. The first was using vanillia JS. \nThe second one was using React, to clone that, this however resulted in a much less clean blog then my previous one. \n\nThe current iteration was done completely from the ground up using react. \n",blogTitle:"Creating The GOAT Blog",image:"https://i.imgur.com/fTyOfpu.gif",id:3}];var O=function(){var e=Object(a.useState)(null),n=Object(i.a)(e,2),t=n[0],o=n[1],s=Object(a.useState)(""),r=Object(i.a)(s,2),m=r[0],u=r[1];return Object(a.useEffect)((function(){o(w)}),[]),t?Object(l.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(l.jsx)(c,{searchHandler:function(e){u(e.target.value)},SearchResult:m}),Object(l.jsx)(v,{}),Object(l.jsx)(p,{SearchResult:m,BlogFetcher:t}),Object(l.jsx)(h,{})]}):Object(l.jsx)("h1",{children:"Loading"})};r.a.render(Object(l.jsx)(o.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(l.jsx)(O,{})}),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[14,1,2]]]);
